# CS_4308_Project
This is the repository for the Scanner implementation for the course CS_4308_Concepts of Programming Language. The Scanner is the front module for both compiler and interpreter. In our implementation, the scanner will scan the whole file of SCL source code, statement by statement, and then output the tokens each statement.
